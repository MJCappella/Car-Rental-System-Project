A teamwork project submitted to the Board of Undergraduate Studies in partial fulfillment for the requirements of the Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science of Egerton University.

To run the project, <strong>run the createdb.py file</strong> after making the appropriate changes. This will create a database that will be used for storing the data for this application.

<ul>
  Next run the app.py file by running:
  <li>
    python app.py - this starts the flask server and you will be redirected to the url <strong>http://127.0.0.1:5000</strong>
  </li>
</ul>
